# Go - Vigilate

A dead simple monitoring service, intended to replace things like Nagios.

## Requirements

Vigilate requires:
- Postgres 11 or later (db is set up as a repository, so other databases are possible)
- An account with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), or a Pusher alternative
  (like [ipê](https://github.com/dimiro1/ipe))

## Run

First, make sure ipê is running (if you're using ipê):

On Mac/Linux
~~~
cd ipe
./ipe 
~~~

On Windows
~~~
cd ipe
ipe.exe
~~~

Run with flags:

~~~
./vigilate \
-dbuser='tcs' \
-pusherHost='localhost' \
-pusherPort='4001' \
-pusherKey='123abc' \
-pusherSecret='abc123' \
-pusherApp="1" \
-pusherSecure=false
